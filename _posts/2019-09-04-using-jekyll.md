I used to have a monolithic html page for blog posts at [/blog]({{site.url}}/blog), but it was neither practical nor sustainable. 

I am now using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a tool that allows me to separate posts in different [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files. For those who are interested in learning more about Jekyll, [this blog post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) was helpful to me. 

As a consequence, for **those who used the previous version of this blog**, you now have: 

- A [main page]({{site.url}}/blog), listing all the posts, sorted by date of publication 
- When you click on a link on [that page]({{site.url}}/blog), you have access to the requested post's page
