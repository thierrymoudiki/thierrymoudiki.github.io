So far with the `teller` ( see [here]({% post_url 2019-11-01-the-teller-1 %}), [here]({% post_url 2019-11-08-the-teller-2 %}) or [here]({% post_url 2019-11-15-the-teller-3 %}) for a refresher), we've been focusing on regression questions. That are, statistical/machine learning (ML) problems in which the variable to be explained is continuous (for example median value of houses, fuel consumption of a car, etc.). In this post, we are going to explore discrete responses, classification. Remember this example with [tomatoes and apples]({% post_url 2019-09-25-nnetsauce-randombag-1 %})? In this specific example, we would like to understand which factors drive an increase or decrease in the probability for a classifier to decide: "it's a tomato". 

The data we use here, are simulated data set containing information on ten thousand customers (appearing in James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., and Tibshirani, R. (2013) An Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R, [www.StatLearning.com](www.StatLearning.com), Springer-Verlag, New York). The aim is to understand what leads to customers' defaults on their credit card debt, considering their income, average balance, and whether they are students or not. The default rate in this dataset is very low, equal to 3\%.



### Install the package and import data 

Currently, the [`teller`](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/teller)'s development version can be obtained from Github as: 

```bash
!pip install git+https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/teller.git
```

Packages and dataset: 

```python
# Import packages and data
import teller as tr

# import data

```

### Model training and explanations


A notebook containing these results can be found [here](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/teller/blob/master/teller/demo/thierrymoudiki_151119_iris_housing.ipynb). Contributions/remarks are welcome as usual, you can submit a pull request [on Github](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/teller).


__Note:__ I am currently looking for a _gig_. You can hire me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/thierrymoudiki) or send me an email: __thierry dot moudiki at pm dot me__. I can do descriptive statistics, data preparation, feature engineering, model calibration, training and validation, and model outputs' interpretation. I am fluent in Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic (among others) and French. My résumé? [Here]({{base}}/cv/thierry-moudiki.pdf)!
