I"˜<p><a href="https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce"><code class="highlighter-rouge">nnetsauce</code></a> is a Python package for Statistical/Machine learning built on top of Numpy, Scipy, and scikit-learn under the BSD license. In nnetsauce, pattern recognition is achieved by combining single-layer networks (SLNN). These SLNN building blocks constitute the basis of many custom models that can be built by the user, including models with <strong>deeper learning architectures</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of use, for illustration:</strong> nnetsauce can (for example) be trained to distinguish between malignant or benign tumors, depending on their characteristics (see examples on <a href="https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce">Github</a>), <strong>with a certain <u>degree of confidence</u></strong> . Or, by using your historical data of income and expenditures, it can be trained to forecast your savings in the next months.</p>

<p>The package is very new. For those who want to try it, give feedback, make it available in R, contribute to the development on <a href="https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce">Github</a>, feel free to jump in.</p>
