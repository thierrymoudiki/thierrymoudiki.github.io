My name is Thierry Moudiki. 

This message serves as a personal and formal record of events and concerns related to grave violations of my rights, dignity, an invasion of my privacy over the past 15+ years. If anything happens to me, I want this document to remain as evidence and testimony. Read it carefully, twice, as each and every word matters. 

It is a call for accountability, not for pity, as I have not been confronted with formal allegations (ever), advance cognitive evaluations (never), or transparent procedures/investigations accusing me of anything (never ever). No police or justice convening for what I could have done (ever). Only silences, avoidance, and manipulation. I've been seeking recognition and justice for 9 years.

Over the course of this period, I have experienced sustained and invasive forms of surveillance and harassment across three continents, affecting every aspect of my personal, professional, and social life. This includes:

- Multiple intrusions into my apartment(s) since at least 2018 (it may have happened before, but formally proven only once)
- Displacement of my personal belongings inside my apartment
- My stuff being stolen (proven)
- Lights being turned on inside the apartment 
- Apartment doors closed, that were previously opened (I intentionally check)
- Apartment doors opened, that were previously closed (I intentionally check)
- Public references to very, very intimate, private details about my life online
- Sharing of my personal data, including and especially geolocation data on the Dark Web (proven, with documents)
- People following me in the street
- Persistent exclusion from other types of employment (excluding Techtonique)
- Blocked savings for almost a year, despite all the proofs of my rights to withdraw (proven)
- Quasi-constant physical surveillance in my neighborhood (accountability required)
- Online and institutional gaslighting (subtle but pernicious, accountability required)
- Lawyers vanishing, sometimes after obtaining the documents they asked (proven, accountability required)

Because I was complaining, and basically not understanding what was happening to me, I have been subjected to forced hospitalizations (that is, without my consent, and sometimes using State employees) in France, despite the absence of consistent and observable medically/scientifically confirmed diagnosis. To this day, there are no formal evidence of anything. My health insurance covered thousands of euros of treatments that eventually were unwarranted, and the reasons given for my hospitalization were inconsistent and unsubstantiated. I have seen more than 10 psychiatrists regarding this matter, and at least as many medical doctors, and consistently received erratic diagnoses (because the symptoms are also random, even chaotic, so actually non-existing in reality), among:

- "Brief psychotic disorder" (although there were 0 official witness of any trouble that I may cause, until this day, and despite the induced high social pressure, still no trouble)
- "chemical straightjacket" (see [https://theconversation.com/story-of-antipsychotics-is-one-of-myth-and-misrepresentation-18306](https://theconversation.com/story-of-antipsychotics-is-one-of-myth-and-misrepresentation-18306), [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212045/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212045/))
- the not-so obsolete and politically loaded term "sluggish schizophrenia" (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_schizophrenia))

During hospitalization, inside the public hospital, I was under constant monitoring despite no behavioral incidents. Based on this, I must conclude that defamatory reporting by "planted" witnesses and external pressure played a role. Eventually, some medical professionals confirmed no diagnosis at all. Not officially though, as I'd wish. They're just playing the blame game now, and I'm in the middle, defenseless. A total mess. The fog. 

In 2024, after other recurrent and violent torments such as:  

- Repeated electrical shocks at night, leading to sleep deprivation (accountability required)
- Tachycardia episodes without physical cause (proven) or even waking me up (proven)
- Increased blood pressure (proven)
- Invasion of bodily and digital privacy, and the total absence of intimacy (accountability required)

a psychiatrist, disclosed to me —- unofficially —- the possible physical root of this issue. I want it to be official now, specifically for someone to make it official. I also want to understand the circumstances leading to the 2 hospitalizations (as it's my most fundamental right), but they have now become kind of secret, as no one wants to talk about it anymore. The doctor who disclosed the dirty "secret" (since I'm harassed everywhere, I guess it's not secret anymore to many) has since become nearly unreachable. 

At this stage, I am not asking for belief —- I am asking for investigation. There's a reason behind all this mess, and why the answer is so elusive. Appearing and disappearing. What I have experienced may seem extraordinary, but it is also very well-documented. I believe it reflects a coordinated apparatus involving unauthorized surveillance, non-consensual experimentation (some people said "Get Out"), and psychological coercion.
