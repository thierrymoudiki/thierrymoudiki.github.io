Data Frames are widely used and useful structures for data wrangling. The `querier` is a query language for Python Data Frames, inspired from SQL's relational databases querying logic. Previous posts about the `querier` can be found [on this blog](https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/#DataBases).

A __documentation for the tool__ is now available on [readthedocs](https://querier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Feel free to __read it__ (of course), __complete it__, or [__correct it__]({% post_url 2020-02-14-git-github %}).

For those who are working from home because of the COVID-19, I'd recommend this __book__, that offers an interesting depiction of our _data-driven_ society:  [Weapons of Math Destruction, How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/) (and nope, I'm not paid to promote this book). Despite its title, the book is __highly accessible__, even to people with __no background in Mathematics__.

__Note:__ I am currently looking for a _gig_. You can hire me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/thierrymoudiki) or send me an email: __thierry dot moudiki at pm dot me__. I can do descriptive statistics, data preparation, feature engineering, model calibration, training and validation, and model outputs' interpretation. I am fluent in Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic (among others) and French. My résumé? [Here]({{base}}/cv/thierry-moudiki.pdf)!
