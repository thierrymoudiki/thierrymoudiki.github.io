# 1 - news

Version 0.6.2 of [`ESGtoolkit`](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338549100_ESGtoolkit_a_tool_for_stochastic_simulation_v020) is now available:

- [on GitHub](https://github.com/Techtonique/esgtoolkit/releases/tag/v0.6.2)
- [on R-universe](https://techtonique.r-universe.dev/ESGtoolkit) 

It is now possible to use _Hermite cubic spline_ and _Smith-Wilson_ methods for yield curve interpolation. 

Starting with version `1.0.0`, the next version, `ESGtoolkit` will be renamed as `esgtoolkit` 
or something similar, as I'm removing all my packages from CRAN.

A **Python version** of `esgtoolkit` will also be available soon on [Techtonique](https://github.com/Techtonique).
