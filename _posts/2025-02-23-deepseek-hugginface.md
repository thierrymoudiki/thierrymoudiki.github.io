Inspired by this publication using R [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-deepseek-r1-api-in-r-with-plumber/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-deepseek-r1-api-in-r-with-plumber/), I created a simple Python Flask API to use DeepSeek R1 and Hugging Face API for chatting. 

The code can be found here:
