A new version (v0.3.1) of `nnetsauce`is now available. The stable version [on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nnetsauce/), and a development version [on Github](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce). Notable changes for this new version are:  

- The inclusion of an upper bound on the error rate of Adaboost: crucial, because the error rate at each iteration has to be at least as good as random guess'.
- New __quasi-randomized networks models for regression and classification, with two shrinkage parameters__ (for model regularization). 

The full list of changes can always be found [here on Github](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce/blob/master/CHANGES.md) and a notebook describing some of the new models (for classification) [here](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce/blob/master/nnetsauce/demo/thierrymoudiki_090120_ridge2_mtask_classification.ipynb) for 4 datasets (with a snippet below on a [wine classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html#sklearn.datasets.load_wine) dataset).

__Note:__ I am currently looking for a _gig_. You can hire me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/thierrymoudiki) or send me an email: __thierry dot moudiki at pm dot me__. I can do descriptive statistics, data preparation, feature engineering, model calibration, training and validation, and model outputs' interpretation. I am fluent in Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic (among others) and French. My résumé? [Here]({{base}}/cv/thierry-moudiki.pdf)!
