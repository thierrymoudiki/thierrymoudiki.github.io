Here are thes slides of my presentation at the International Symposium on Forecasting today: 

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381957724_Probabilistic_Forecasting_with_RandomizedQuasi-Randomized_networks_presentation_at_the_International_Symposium_on_Forecasting_2024](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381957724_Probabilistic_Forecasting_with_RandomizedQuasi-Randomized_networks_presentation_at_the_International_Symposium_on_Forecasting_2024)

I discussed probabilistic Forecasting with quasi-randomized networks, sequential split conformal prediction, and GPU computation in Python package `nnetsauce` (thanks to [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)). Bonus slides: Automated Forecasting (sort of) with `nnetsauce`'s `LazyMTS` and time series cross-validation with `nnetsauce`'s `TimeSeriesSplit`.

Thanks to the organizers for allowing me to present my independent work on `nnetsauce`. These conferences are always a great opportunity to meet new people (or people we've heard about for a long time), and share our passion.
