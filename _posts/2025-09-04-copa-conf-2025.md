I'm supposed to present a poster for this publication of mine [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v266/moudiki25a.html](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v266/moudiki25a.html)
 in London in a few days at [COPA CONFERENCE 2025](https://copa-conference.com/) but it's nearly impossible. Could anybody guess why? Hint in the links below.
