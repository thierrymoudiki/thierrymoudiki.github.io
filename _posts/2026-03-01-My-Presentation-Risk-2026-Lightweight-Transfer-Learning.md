At the [Risk 2026](https://rconsortium.github.io/Risk_website/Abstracts.html#lightweight-transfer-learning-for-financial-forecasting-using-quasi-randomized-networks) conference organized by the R consortium, I presented "Lightweight Transfer Learning for Financial Forecasting Using Quasi-Randomized Networks". Here are the slides:
