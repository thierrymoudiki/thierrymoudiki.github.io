Two variants of __Adaboost__ (Adaptive boosting) algorithms are now included in the development version of `nnetsauce`, available on [`Github`](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce). My `nnetsauce` implementation of Adaboost has __some specificities__, as it will be shown in the sequel of this post. It is also worth noting that the __current implementation is 100% Python__ (neither underlying C, nor C++). 

The package can be imported from Github, by doing:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce.git
```

I'll show you how to use these Adaboost classifiers on two popular datasets. 


First, a few words about statistical/machine learning (ML hereafter). ML is about __pattern recognition__. A phenomenon that has a trend or a seasonality, such as the evolution of the __weather__, can be studied by ML. Other use cases  include  identifying __fraudulent transactions__ (unless, of course, the smarts increase at a dramatically fast pace), determining if a tumor is __benign or malignant__, __natural language processing__, etc. On the other hand ML cannot say which of heads or tail will appear next when you flip a _fair_ coin. By using __statistical inference__, you can derive quantities such as the probability of the number of trials until head or tails appear, but that's it. 

__Another illustration__ is presented below. All that I can say about my __simulated stock returns__ (on the left), is that their average is 0, and their standard deviation is 1. Trying to predict the next return will (extremely) likely give me: 0. On the right, I can see a trend in my __simulated rents__. So, I can predict more or less accurately the rent of an appartment; assuming that an increase of 1 squared meter in and appartment's surface produces an increase of 3â‚¬ in rents.

__Adaboost__ is an ML algorithm, i.e it achieves pattern recognition. More specifically, it's an __ensemble learning__ algorithm called _boosting_. For more details about boosting in general, the interested reader can consult [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332291211_Forecasting_multivariate_time_series_with_boosted_configuration_networks). And for Adaboost in particular, [that one](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~g8acai/teaching/C11/Handouts/AdaBoost.pdf). The aim of ensemble learning is to combine multiple individual ML models  into one. _Ensembling_ thus aims at obtaining a model, that has an improved recognition error over the individual models' recognition error. And __most of the times, it works__. 

We start by __importing the packages necessary for the job__, along with `nnetsauce` (namely `numpy` and `sklearn`, nothing weird!):

```python
import nnetsauce as ns
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer, load_wine, load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import metrics
```

Our __first example__ is based on `wisconsin breast cancer` dataset from [UCI (University of California at Irvine) repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and available in `sklearn`. More details about the content of these datasets can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) and [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). `wisconsin breast cancer` dataset is splitted into a __training set__ (for training the model to pattern recognition) and __test set__ (for model validation):

```python
# Import dataset from sklearn
breast_cancer = load_breast_cancer()
X = breast_cancer.data
y = breast_cancer.target

# training test and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=123)
```

The first version of Adaboost that we apply is __`SAMME.R`__, also known as Real Adaboost. The acronym `SAMME` stands for Stagewise Additive Modeling using a Multi-class Exponential loss function, and  [`nnetsauce`](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce)'s implementation of `SAMME` has some __specificities__:

-The base learners (individual models in the ensemble) are quasi-randomized (__deterministic__) networks.

-At each boosting iteration, a fraction of dataset's observations can be randomly chosen, in order to increase diversity within the ensemble.

-For `SAMME` (not for `SAMME.R`, yet), an experimental feature allows to apply an __elastic net__-like constraint to individual observations weights. That is: the norm of these individual weights can be bounded during the learning procedure. I am curious to hear how well (or not) it works for you.

```python
# SAMME.R

# base learner
clf = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', multi_class = 'ovr', 
                         random_state=123)

# nnetsauce's Adaboost
fit_obj = ns.AdaBoostClassifier(clf, 
                                n_hidden_features=11, 
                                direct_link=True,
                                n_estimators=250, learning_rate=0.01126343,
                                col_sample=0.72684326, row_sample=0.86429443,
                                dropout=0.63078613, n_clusters=2,
                                type_clust="gmm",
                                verbose=1, seed = 123, 
                                method="SAMME.R")  

```

The base learner, `clf`, is a logistic regression model __but it could be anything__ including decision trees. `fit_obj` is a `nnetsauce` object that augments `clf` with a hidden layer of transformed predictors, and typically makes `clf`'s predictions nonlinear. `n_hidden_features` is the number of nodes in the hidden layer, and `dropout` randomly drops some of these nodes at each boosting iteration (which reduces overtraining). `col_sample` and `row_sample` specify the __fraction of columns and rows__ chosen for fitting the base learner at each  iteration. With `n_clusters`, the data can be clustered into homogeneous groups before model training.

__`nnetsauce`'s Adaboost can now be fitted__; `250` iterations are used:


```python
# Fitting the model to training set 
fit_obj.fit(X_train, y_train)  

# Obtain model's accuracy on test set
print(fit_obj.score(X_test, y_test))
```

With the following graph, we can __visualize how well our data have been classified__ by `nnetsauce`'s Adaboost.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns; sns.set()
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
preds = fit_obj.predict(X_test)
mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, preds)
sns.heatmap(mat.T, square=True, annot=True, fmt='d', cbar=False)
plt.xlabel('true label')
plt.ylabel('predicted label');
```

`1` denotes a malignant tumor, and `0`, its absence. For the 3 (out of 114) patients remaining missclassified, it could be interesting to change the model `sample_weight`s, and give them more weight in the learning procedure. Then, we could see how well the result evolves with this change;  depending on which classifier's decision we consider being the worst (or best). But note that: 

1.__The model will never be perfect__ (plus, the labels are based on human-eyed labelling ;) ). Still: though he said "all models are wrong", he didn't mean "are false". He meant wrong in the sense that these are simply (even sometimes, great) representations of a reality. "False"	 would be: wrong to an extent that can't be tolerated. And indeed in that regard, some models are false, for certain purposes. If I fit a model to this dataset and get an accuracy of 30%, no matter how sophisticated or expensive it is, the model is just plainly unacceptable - __for that purpose__.

2.Patients are not labelled. _Label_ is just a generic term in classification, for all types of classification models and data. Here, those are `0` and `1`.	


Our __second example__ is based on `wine` dataset from [UCI repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). This dataset contains information about wines' quality, depending on their characteristics. With ML applied to this dataset, we can deduce the quality of a wine, previously unseen, by using its characteristics. `SAMME` is now used instead of `SAMME.R`. This second algorithm seems to require more iterations to converge than `SAMME.R` (but you, tell me from your experience!):

```python
# load dataset
wine = load_wine()
Z = wine.data
t = wine.target
np.random.seed(123)
Z_train, Z_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(Z, t, test_size=0.2)


# SAMME
clf = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', multi_class = 'ovr', 
                         random_state=123)
fit_obj = ns.AdaBoostClassifier(clf, 
                                n_hidden_features=np.int(8.21154785e+01), 
                                direct_link=True,
                                n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=2.96252441e-02,
                                col_sample=4.22766113e-01, row_sample=7.87268066e-01,
                                dropout=1.56909180e-01, n_clusters=3,
                                type_clust="gmm",
                                verbose=1, seed = 123, 
                                method="SAMME") 
 
 # Fitting the model to training set
fit_obj.fit(Z_train, y_train)  
```

After fitting the model, we can obtain some statistics about its quality (`accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `f1-score`; every `nnetsauce` model is 100% `sklearn`-compatible) in classifying unseen wines:

```python
# model predictions on unseen wines 
preds = fit_obj.predict(Z_test)     

# descriptive statistics of model performance
print(metrics.classification_report(preds, y_test))    
```
