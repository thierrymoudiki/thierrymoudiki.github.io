**Disclaimer:** I have no affiliation with the TabPFN packages. I just found the package's idea interesting and thought it would be a good idea to try it out for forecasting.

More details on nnetsauce forecasting can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382589729_Probabilistic_Forecasting_with_nnetsauce_using_Density_Estimation_Bayesian_inference_Conformal_prediction_and_Vine_copulas).
