**ICYMI: RPweave — Unified R + Python + LaTeX Workflow (Powered by uv)**

If you juggle **R**, **Python**, and **LaTeX** for research, you know the pain: fragmented scripts, mixed environments, manual copying, and fragile reproducibility.

I needed a setup/workflow that handles **both languages**, **any LaTeX template**, **environment isolation**, and a **command-line–first workflow** — so I assembled **RPweave**. Not a new idea, but a polished, modern take that just works.

**RPweave** (GitHub template here: [https://github.com/Techtonique/RPweave](https://github.com/Techtonique/RPweave)) ties everything together using:

* **knitr** for R + Python chunks
* **reticulate** for seamless Python integration
* **LaTeX** for publication-ready typesetting
* **uv** for fast, reproducible Python environments
* **Makefile automation** for building and previewing
* A ready-to-clone **Git template**

---

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Techtonique/RPweave my-paper
cd my-paper
uv venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
make setup
make view
```

---

### Why It Matters

RPweave lets you:

* Run **R** and **Python** in the same `.Rnw` document at the command line
* Easily share objects across languages
* Use any LaTeX template or academic style
* Keep everything reproducible with isolated environments
* Build your PDF with a single command (`make view`)

---

### Minimal Example

The first chunk is mandatory. 

```latex
<<setup>>=
library(knitr); library(reticulate)
use_python("venv/bin/python")
@

<<r-analysis>>=
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
@

<<python-analysis, engine='python'>>=
import pandas as pd
print(pd.DataFrame({'x': range(100)}).describe())
@
```

---

### Ideal For

* Papers mixing **R stats** + **Python ML**
* Projects needing clean **LaTeX** output
* Reproducible workflows with pinned dependencies
* Researchers tired of context-switching between RStudio, Jupyter, and LaTeX editors

---

### Pro Tips

* Use `make view` as your main loop — instant rebuild + preview
* Store long chunks in `chunks/`
* Keep generated files out of Git
* Pass data R → Python via `py$object` for smooth cross-language flows
