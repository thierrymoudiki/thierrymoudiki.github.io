As someone who's been using the statistical computing language R for 15 years now, I'd been  wondering if there was __a way to call my favorite R functions from Python__. If you've been asking yourself too, yes, there is a way: __using [rpy2](https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/)__. 

`rpy2` can be installed from the command line as:

```bash
pip install rpy2
```

In order to install the R packages necessary for our	 demo, we'll use the following Python code snippet (that I adapted from here: [http://www.pybloggers.com/2015/12/r-from-python-an-rpy2-tutorial/](http://www.pybloggers.com/2015/12/r-from-python-an-rpy2-tutorial/)). This script first __checks if the R packages that we need are already installed, and if not, it installs them__:

```python
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
import rpy2.robjects.packages as rpackages
from rpy2.robjects import numpy2ri
from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
from rpy2.robjects.vectors import StrVector

import numpy as np


required_packages = ['base', 'forecast'] # list of required R packages 

if all(rpackages.isinstalled(x) for x in required_packages):
    check_packages = True # True if packages are already installed 
else:
   check_packages = False # False if packages are not installed 

if check_packages == False: # Not installed? Then install.

    utils = rpackages.importr('utils')
    utils.chooseCRANmirror(ind=1)

    packages_to_install = [x for x in required_packages if not rpackages.isinstalled(x)]

    if len(packages_to_install) > 0:

        utils.install_packages(StrVector(packages_to_install))

    check_packages = True 
```

If the script doesn't work on your machine, you'll have to install the R packages (actually, R package `forecast`)  from the R console (as you usually do that) and continue. Now in Python, we can __import all the modules__ that we want for our demo:

```python
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
import rpy2.robjects.packages as rpackages
from rpy2.robjects import numpy2ri
from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
from rpy2.robjects.vectors import StrVector

import numpy as np
```

Plus (still in Python), the __R packages__ and __R objects__ :

```python
r = robjects.r
base = importr('base')
forecast = importr('forecast')
graphics = importr('graphics')
grdevices = importr('grDevices')
```

For the __creation of an R time series__ object, we do:

```python
base.set_seed(123) # reproducibility seed
x = r.ts(r.rnorm(n=10)) # simulate the time series
print(x)
```

```python
Time Series:
Start = 1 
End = 10 
Frequency = 1 
 [1] -0.56047565 -0.23017749  1.55870831  0.07050839  0.12928774  1.71506499
 [7]  0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197

```

__Forecasting__ our time series using the Theta method is done as:

```python
# Forecasting horizon
h = 5

# Use theta for forecasting
res_thetaf = forecast.thetaf(x, h = h)

print(res_thetaf)
```
```
Point Forecast     Lo 80     Hi 80     Lo 95    Hi 95
11     -0.3349355 -1.631470 0.9615991 -2.317814 1.647943
12     -0.3759211 -1.672456 0.9206135 -2.358800 1.606958
13     -0.4169067 -1.713441 0.8796279 -2.399785 1.565972
14     -0.4578923 -1.754427 0.8386423 -2.440771 1.524986
15     -0.4988779 -1.795413 0.7976567 -2.481757 1.484001

```


We can even __plot the time series forecast__ (this has been tested on macOS, hopefully it works on your machine too):

```
grdevices.X11()
graphics.plot(res_thetaf)
```

For those who wonder if this is an ancient-medieval-technique-revealed-by-T (and are interested in hacking all my social media), __nope it isn't__. You can find out in the official package [documentation](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/introduction.html).  I'd be interested to __hear if there are Python packages similar to rpy2__. If yes, then __drop me an email!__


__Note:__ I am currently looking for a _gig_. You can hire me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/thierrymoudiki) or send me an email: __thierry dot moudiki at pm dot me__. I can do descriptive statistics, data preparation, feature engineering, model calibration, training and validation, and model outputs' interpretation. I am fluent in Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic (among others) and French. My résumé? [Here]({{base}}/cv/thierry-moudiki.pdf)!
