[www.techtonique.net](www.techtonique.net)'s API is based on R and Python code from the [Techtonique](https://github.com/Techtonique) project's packages.

The web app now contains a user-friendly graphical interface to the API allowing you to use buttons to interact with it (will eventually include graphical representations of the responses). Just navigate to [www.techtonique.net/apidisplay](https://www.techtonique.net/apidisplay) to play with it.

The graphical interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to interact with the API without needing extensive programming knowledge. It provides a straightforward way to access various functionalities offered by the Techtonique project.

The interface is still under development, and more features will be added over time. Users can expect enhancements that will make it even easier to utilize the API's capabilities.

For now, you can explore the existing functionalities and provide feedback to help shape future updates. The goal is to create a comprehensive tool that meets the needs of both casual users and developers.
