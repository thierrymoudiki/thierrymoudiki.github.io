Time series [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) is now available in [crossval](https://github.com/Techtonique/crossval), using function `crossval::crossval_ts`. Main parameters for `crossval::crossval_ts` include:

- `fixed_window` described below in sections 1 and 2, and indicating if the training set's size is fixed or increasing through cross-validation iterations
- `initial_window`: the number of points in the rolling training set
- `horizon`: the number of points in the rolling testing set

Yes, this type of functionality exists in packages such as `caret`, or `forecast`, but with different flavours. We start by installing [crossval](https://github.com/Techtonique/crossval) from its online repository (in R's console): 

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("thierrymoudiki/crossval")
library(crossval)
```

## 1 - Calling `crossval_ts` with option `fixed_window = TRUE`

![image-title-here]({{base}}/images/2020-03-27/2020-03-27-image1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

`initial_window`is the length of the training set, depicted in blue, which is __fixed__ through cross-validation iterations. `horizon` is the length of the testing set, in orange. 


### 1 - 1 Using statistical learning functions

```r
data("AirPassengers")

# regressors including trend 
xreg <- cbind(1, 1:length(AirPassengers))

# cross validation with least squares regression
res <- crossval_ts(y=AirPassengers, x=xreg, fit_func = crossval::fit_lm,
predict_func = crossval::predict_lm,
initial_window = 10,
horizon = 3,
fixed_window = TRUE)

# print results
print(colMeans(res))
```
```r
       ME        RMSE         MAE         MPE        MAPE 
 0.16473829 71.42382836 67.01472299  0.02345201  0.22106607 
```

### 1 - 2 Using time series functions from  package `forecast` 

```r
res <- crossval_ts(y=AirPassengers, initial_window = 10, 
	horizon = 3,
	fcast_func = forecast::thetaf, 
	fixed_window = TRUE)
print(colMeans(res))
```
```r
        ME         RMSE          MAE          MPE         MAPE 
 2.657082195 51.427170382 46.511874693  0.003423843  0.155428590 
```

## 2 - Calling `crossval_ts` with option `fixed_window = FALSE`

`initial_window`is the length of the training set, in blue, which __increases__ through cross-validation iterations. `horizon` is the length of the testing set, depicted in orange.

# print results
print(colMeans(res))

__Note:__ I am currently looking for a _gig_. You can hire me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/thierrymoudiki) or send me an email: __thierry dot moudiki at pm dot me__. I can do descriptive statistics, data preparation, feature engineering, model calibration, training and validation, and model outputs' interpretation. I am fluent in Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic (among others) and French. My résumé? [Here]({{base}}/cv/thierry-moudiki.pdf)!
