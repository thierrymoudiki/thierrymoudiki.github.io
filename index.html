	    <p>In early December 1891, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians">Canadian</a> Dr. James Naismith, a physical education professor and instructor at the <strong>International Young Men's Christian Association Training School</strong> (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.</p> 


	    <p>He sought a <strong>vigorous indoor game</strong> to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a <strong>10-foot (3.0 m) elevated track</strong>. In contrast with modern basketball nets:</p> 

	    <ul>
	    	<li>
	    		this peach basket retained its bottom		
	    	</li>
	    	<li>
	    		balls had to be retrieved manually after each <em>basket</em> or point scored
	    	</li>
	    </ul>


	    <p>This proved <em>inefficient</em>, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.</p>
