A few announcements this week, ahead of the more exciting coming weeks: 

- A new version of [mlsauce](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/mlsauce) (see [AdaOpt classification on MNIST handwritten digits (without preprocessing)]({% post_url 2020-05-29-adaopt-classifier-3 %}), [AdaOpt (a probabilistic classifier based on a mix of multivariable optimization and nearest neighbors) for R]({% post_url 2020-05-22-adaopt-classifier-2 %}), and [AdaOpt]({% post_url 2020-05-15-adaopt-classifier-1 %})) will be released __next week__, with new features not related to `AdaOpt`. Both in R and Python.
- The week after that, I will write about the sequel of [maximizing your tip as a waiter]({% post_url 2020-06-05-target-encoder-correlation-2 %}). 
- In three weeks a new version of [nnetsauce](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce) (see [here](http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/index.html#QuasiRandomizedNN)) will be released, also including new features; both in R and Python.
