**[Techtonique](https://www.techtonique.net) has now been released, with 3 different pricing tiers (including a free one)**. 

As a reminder, **the tool is designed to help you make informed, data-driven decisions using Mathematics, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization**. Experiencing issues for signing-in or anything else? Simply send an email to [support@techtonique.net](mailto:support@techtonique.net). 

Both clickable no-code web interfaces and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are available in the platform. The _cool_ point about APIs is that they are programming language-agnostic (supporting Python, R, JavaScript, etc.), relatively fast, and require no additional package installation before use. This means you can keep using your preferred programming language or legacy code/tools, as long as it can talk to the internet. In doubt? Ask your IT team.

[This tutorial](https://moudiki2.gumroad.com/l/nrhgb) is a step-by-step guide for helping you in getting familiar with the Techtonique platform.


[The tutorial](https://moudiki2.gumroad.com/l/nrhgb) covers the basics of the platform, including how to upload data, how to use the different models, and how to interact with the Application Programming Interface (API). The contents are organized as follows (depending on your tastes):

- Visual resources: A short video showcasing the platform's features.
- Audio resources: A podcast describing the platform's features.
- Slides: A slide deck summarizing the platform's features.
- Code: Code examples demonstrating the platform's API features for various programming languages.
- Excel: A file containing VBA code to interact with the platform's API (Read the code to understand what it does)
- R: A file with R code to interact with the platform's API. In R console, run `source("./06-r-resources/r-example.R", encoding = "UTF-8")`
- Python: A file with Python code to interact with the platform's API. Run `python3 05-python-resources/python-example.py` to see the results.
- JavaScript: A file with JavaScript code to interact with the platform's API (interactive graph, read the code to understand what it does)
- Command line: A file with command line code ([`curl`](https://curlconverter.com/)) to interact with the platform's API

Currently **available functionalities** include:

- [Data visualization](https://lnkd.in/euqWYSij): Which variables are correlated?
- [Probabilistic forecasting](https://lnkd.in/ec6_bSk8): Range of my projected sales?
- [Machine Learning](https://lnkd.in/ewFzRej) (regression or classification) for tabular datasets: What is the price range of an apartment based on its size and number of rooms?
- [Survival analysis](https://lnkd.in/ejB5C3hC), analyzing *time-to-event* data: How long might a patient live after being diagnosed, and how accurate is this prediction?
- [Reserving](https://lnkd.in/ei5DNWrT) based on historical insurance claims data, how much is necessary to cover future potential accidents?
