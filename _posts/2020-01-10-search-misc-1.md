Hi everyone, best wishes for 2020 to you and yours. For this new year, there's some novelty [on the blog]({{site.url}}/blog): a __search bar__ that allows to search rapidly for specific keywords in previous blog posts.

![image-title-here]({{base}}/images/2020-01-10/2020-01-10-image1.png){:class="img-responsive"}


After clicking on the blue button on the right (or pressing 'Enter' after typing your request), make sure to __scroll down__ to get the actual results from the blog. 

And in case you missed it before the holidays, this [2019 recap]({% post_url 2019-12-20-recap-1 %}) will be useful for you to have an extended overview of the ecosystem of packages discussed in this blog. 


__Note:__ I am currently looking for a _gig_. You can hire me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/thierrymoudiki) or send me an email: __thierry dot moudiki at pm dot me__.
