Documentation for GPopt, a package for Bayesian optimization [is now available](https://techtonique.github.io/GPopt/) -- along with its source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/Techtonique/GPopt). You can read the **previous posts** related to GPopt below: 

- [Bayesian Optimization with GPopt](https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/2021/04/16/python/misc/gpopt)
- [Bayesian Optimization with GPopt Part 2 (save and resume)](https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/2021/04/30/python/misc/gpopt)
- [Hyperparameters tuning with GPopt](https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/2021/06/11/python/misc/hyperparam-tuning-gpopt)


For this documentation, I used [keras-autodoc](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-autodoc), [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), 
and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as usual. Why? Because [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)! <3
I didn't have to learn a new language, namely, [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).
