Statistical/Machine learning models often depend on many _hyperparameters_, that define and control their learning capabilities. [`crossval`](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/crossval) is an `R` package that calculates these models' learning performances on given datasets, as a function of their hyperparameters. 


For those who want to contribute to the package development or improve it on [`Github`](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/crossval), feel free to jump in.
