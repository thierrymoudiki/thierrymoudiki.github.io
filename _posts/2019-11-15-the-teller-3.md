As mentioned here 2 weeks ago, when introducting the [`teller`](https://github.com/Techtonique/teller), there is an increasing need for __transparency__ and __fairness__ in Statistical/Machine Learning (ML) models predictions. Some ML models which are not linear are considered as being _black boxes_, but they may exhibit high accuracy numbers. Since we do not want to sacrifice this high accuracy to explainability, we can use the `teller`, a __model-agnostic tool for ML explainability__, to understand them a little bit more.

In this post, we are going to use the `teller` to compare two ML models on the Boston Housing dataset:  

- [Extremely Randomized  Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest#ExtraTrees) 
- Random Forest Regressions 

Why am I using this dataset this much? Not because I'm a real estate agent, but: 

- It's widely used and well-studied in ML 
- It's directly available to everyone through (the also widely used) R package `MASS`, and Python's  [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  
- It has a moderate size, ideal for demos
- It allows to derive insights which are interesting, and understandable by almost everyone

I also found the paper: Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. (1978) _Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air_. J. Environ. Economics and Management 5, 81–102, to be an interesting and accessible read. If you are interested.

__Data description__: The response (variable to be explained) is MEDV, Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000’s.

- CRIM per capita crime rate by town
- ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- RAD index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town
- LSTAT % lower status of the population
- MEDV Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000’s (the __reponse__)


### Install the package and import data 

Currently, the [`teller`](https://github.com/Techtonique/teller)'s development version can be obtained from Github as: 

```bash
!pip install git+https://github.com/Techtonique/teller.git
```

Packages and dataset: 

```python
# Import packages and data
import teller as tr
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np   
import lightgbm as lgb
import xgboost as xgb
import math

from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, BaggingRegressor
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn import metrics

# import data
boston = datasets.load_boston()
X = np.delete(boston.data, 11, 1)
y = boston.target
col_names = np.append(np.delete(boston.feature_names, 11), 'MEDV')
```

### Model training and explanations

We split data into a training and a testing set:

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=123)
print(X_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
print("mean of y_test: ")
print(np.mean(y_test))
print("std. deviation of y_test: ")
print(np.std(y_test))
```

Now we train our 2 models, starting with the __Extremely Randomized Trees__:

```python
# fit an Extra Trees model to Boston Housing data
regr2 = ExtraTreesRegressor(n_estimators=1000, 
                            max_features=int(math.sqrt(X_train.shape[1])),
                            random_state=123)
regr2.fit(X_train, y_train)


# creating the explainer
expr2 = tr.Explainer(obj=regr2)


# fitting the explainer (for heterogeneity of effects only)
expr2.fit(X_test, y_test, X_names=col_names[:-1], y_name=col_names[-1], method="avg")


# confidence intervals and tests on marginal effects (Jackknife)
expr2.fit(X_test, y_test, X_names=col_names[:-1], y_name=col_names[-1], method="ci")


# summary of results for the model
print(expr2.summary())
```

```

![Extra Trees]({{base}}/images/2019-11-15/2019-11-15-image1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Extra Trees predictions for home value are highly sensisitive to air pollution. And increase of 1 in nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) leads, all else held constant and on average, to a decrease of 58k$ in median homes' values. The increase in home value is driven by the number of rooms. We can also note that variables such as criminality rate and the accessibility to radial highways, seem to have a negligible impact on model predictions.

Now, we'll train a __Random Forest__ on the same dataset, and see what it tells us about its predictions: 

```python
# fit a random forest model 
regr1 = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=1000, 
                              max_features=int(math.sqrt(X_train.shape[1])),
                              random_state=123)
regr1.fit(X_train, y_train)


# creating the explainer
expr1 = tr.Explainer(obj=regr1)


# fitting the explainer (for heterogeneity of effects only)
expr1.fit(X_test, y_test, X_names=col_names[:-1], y_name=col_names[-1], method="avg")


# confidence intervals and tests on marginal effects (Jackknife)
expr1.fit(X_test, y_test, X_names=col_names[:-1], y_name=col_names[-1], method="ci")


# summary of results for the model
print(expr1.summary())
```

```

For this model too, air pollution is an important variable driving the decrease in home value. The lack of teachers for each kid plays a more important role here, but contrary to Extra Trees, Random Forests give much more importance to the accessibility of radial highways.

### Comparing models 

We can finally __compare both models side by side__, using the `teller`'s `Comparator`:

```python
# create object for model comparison
# expr1 is for Random Forest 
# expr2 is for Extra Trees
cpr = tr.Comparator(expr1, expr2)


# print summary of results for model comparison
print(cpr.summary())
```

```

The first output is test set Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both models, then we have information such as Multiple R-Squared and the distribution of residuals. Confidence interval (given by a Student t-test) around the difference of residuals means contains 0, so the null hypothesis is not rejected at 5%.

A notebook containing these results can be found [here](https://github.com/Techtonique/teller/blob/master/teller/demo/thierrymoudiki_151119_boston_housing.ipynb). Contributions/remarks are welcome as usual, you can submit a pull request [on Github](https://github.com/Techtonique/teller).
