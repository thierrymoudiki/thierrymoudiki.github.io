If you're looking for **most recent releases** of Techtonique's R packages like `ahead`, `bayesianrvfl`, `bcn`, or `esgtoolkit` (not available on CRAN), you can use the CRAN-like repository located at: [https://r-packages.techtonique.net](https://r-packages.techtonique.net). 

Here's how:

```R
# once and for all
options(repos = c(
                    techtonique = "https://r-packages.techtonique.net",
                    CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
                ))

install.packages("package_name")                
```

Otherwise, you can install the package from source, and the sources are available at (link in left column):

[https://r-packages.techtonique.net/packages](https://r-packages.techtonique.net/packages)
