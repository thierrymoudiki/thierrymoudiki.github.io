I"s<p>Statistical/Machine learning models often depend on many <em>hyperparameters</em>, that define and control their learning capabilities. <a href="https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/crossval"><code class="highlighter-rouge">crossval</code></a> is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> package that calculates these modelsâ€™ learning performances on given datasets, as a function of their hyperparameters.</p>

<p>For those who want to contribute to the package development or improve it on <a href="https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/crossval"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Github</code></a>, feel free to jump in.</p>
