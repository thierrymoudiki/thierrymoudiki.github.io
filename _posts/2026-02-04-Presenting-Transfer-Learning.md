At the "Risk 2026" conference organized by the R consortium, I will be presenting "Lightweight Transfer Learning for Financial Forecasting Using Quasi-Randomized Networks":

*small typo in the abstract (my mistake): "architectural priors" would work here too, in the Bayesian context of [https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/2025/07/01/r/python/ridge2-bayesian](https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/2025/07/01/r/python/ridge2-bayesian), but so far, it's not Bayesian, and it's about optimizing hyperparameters not priors.
