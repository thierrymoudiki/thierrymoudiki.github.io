If you're a Pythonista, you've probably been hearing about [Anaconda's](https://www.anaconda.com/) `PyScript` in the past few 
days. Since it's been introduced at PyCon US 2022, its growth in terms of GitHub stars has been spectacular (to those who are downloading/using [my packages](https://github.com/Techtonique) thousands of times each month, 
I would appreciate to earn your GitHub stars too ;) )!

So, what is `PyScript`? It's a framework that allows users to create Python applications in the browser using HTML (using it in conjunction with Javascript can be helpful too). The best way that I found to **get started** with `PyScript` was to [read this article](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/blob/main/GETTING-STARTED.md), and here is 
a simple example adapted from the article: 

```html
<html>

  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
    <script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- The date will appear in the label with id "today" -->
    <p>
      Today is <u><label id='today'></label></u>
    </p>
    
    <!-- Python code to print today's date in label with id "today" -->
    <py-script>
import datetime as dt
pyscript.write('today', dt.date.today().strftime('%A %B %d, %Y'))
    </py-script>
  </body>
  
</html>
```

There are **three things that I like** about `PyScript`: 

  - **Nothing to install**; you just need a text editor to code a PyScript app
  
  - **No other _dialect_ to learn**: it's HTML (and Javascript) and Python
  
  - A `PyScript` app can be **deployed instantaneously** in the browser

With that said, **the project is still in its infancy**, and according to its [ GitHub organization](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript#notes), as of 05/08/2022, it's **extremely experimental**. 
Indeed, IMHO, the apps are still relatively slow to start. It will certainly get better with time though, as more people are joining to contribute.

Other advanced examples can be found in [here](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/tree/main/pyscriptjs/examples). I deployed the Super Mario Bros © example [on my website](https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/mario/). To get started, scroll the page and wait a few seconds until "Loaded Model!" appears at the bottom (third row). Then, use <- -> to move, and x to jump. If you own the copyright and want me to remove this game from my website, do not hesitate to contact me.
