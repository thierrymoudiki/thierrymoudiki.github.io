[Last week]({% post_url 2019-11-01-the-teller-1 %}), I introduced the [`teller`](https://github.com/Techtonique/teller), a __model-agnostic tool for ML explainability__. The `teller`'s philosophy is to rely on [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) to explain ML models predictions: a little increase in model's explanatory variables + a little decrease, and we can obtain approximate sensitivities of its predictions to changes in these explanatory variables.

This new version of the package (v0.2.0) improves the interface, and introduces [Jackknife](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling) Student t-tests for the significance of marginal effects. For these tests, you'll need to have at least 30 observations in the testing set.  

## Installation 

Currently from Github, for the development version: 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Techtonique/teller.git
```

## Significance of marginal effects

The following notebook will give you an introduction to this functionality:

Contributions/remarks are welcome as usual, you can submit a pull request [on Github](https://github.com/Techtonique/teller).


__Note:__ I am currently looking for a _gig_. You can hire me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/thierrymoudiki) or send me an email: __thierry dot moudiki at pm dot me__. I can do descriptive statistics, data preparation, feature engineering, model calibration, training and validation, and model outputs' interpretation. I am fluent in Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic (among others) and French. My résumé? [Here]({{base}}/cv/thierry-moudiki.pdf)!
