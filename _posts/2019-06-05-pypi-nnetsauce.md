Machine Learning and Deep Learning package [`nnetsauce`](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce) (introduced [here]({% post_url 2019-03-13-nnetsauce %}) ) is now available on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/) -- and I'm so proud of it ;). Which means, you can install it by using the command line: 

```bash
pip install nnetsauce
```

For more **examples of use of this package**, you can consult [this post]({%post_url 2019-05-09-more-nnetsauce %}), or the [package's Github repo](https://github.com/thierrymoudiki/nnetsauce) README.
